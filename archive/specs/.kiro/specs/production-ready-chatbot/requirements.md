# Production-Ready Chatbot Requirements

## Introduction

The current chatbot system is functioning well with Gemini 2.0 Flash integration, function calling, and Turkish language support. However, it lacks critical production-ready features needed for deployment and maintenance. This specification addresses the gaps in cost tracking, monitoring, error handling, caching, and deployment infrastructure to transform the system from a working prototype to a production-ready application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper development environment with virtual environment and dependency management, so that the project can be safely deployed and maintained without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a Python virtual environment
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use a requirements.txt file with pinned versions
3. WHEN committing to Git THEN the system SHALL exclude virtual environment and sensitive files via .gitignore
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL have consistent dependency versions across environments

### Requirement 2: Cost Tracking and Budget Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time cost tracking for API calls, so that I can monitor expenses and prevent budget overruns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to Gemini THEN the system SHALL calculate and track the actual cost based on token usage
2. WHEN daily cost exceeds 80% of budget THEN the system SHALL log a warning
3. WHEN daily cost exceeds budget THEN the system SHALL log a critical alert
4. WHEN requesting cost reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns by service, time period, and usage patterns
5. WHEN exporting cost data THEN the system SHALL generate JSON reports with historical data

### Requirement 3: Performance Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring, so that I can identify bottlenecks and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL track response times, CPU usage, and memory consumption
2. WHEN response time exceeds 500ms THEN the system SHALL log a performance warning
3. WHEN response time exceeds 2000ms THEN the system SHALL log a critical performance alert
4. WHEN system resources exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide health status indicators
5. WHEN requesting system metrics THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance dashboards

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured error handling and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information with context
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL use different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
4. WHEN errors are critical THEN the system SHALL provide detailed stack traces and request context
5. WHEN analyzing logs THEN the system SHALL support log aggregation and filtering

### Requirement 5: Advanced Caching System

**User Story:** As a system user, I want faster response times through intelligent caching, so that frequently requested information loads quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL use Redis for distributed caching
2. WHEN cache entries expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh stale data
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cache eviction policies
4. WHEN similar queries are made THEN the system SHALL serve cached results when appropriate
5. WHEN cache is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to direct API calls

### Requirement 6: Intent Detection Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to correctly understand ambiguous greetings and responses, so that conversations feel natural and contextually appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user says "tamam" THEN the system SHALL respond with follow-up questions instead of confusion
2. WHEN user says "iyi günler" THEN the system SHALL determine if it's a greeting or farewell based on context
3. WHEN user provides acknowledgments THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately and offer further assistance
4. WHEN user says farewell phrases THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate closing responses
5. WHEN intent is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use context clues to make intelligent decisions

### Requirement 7: Product Search Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate product search results even with complex queries, so that I can find the exact products I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for "hamile lohusa takım" THEN the system SHALL return relevant maternity/nursing sets
2. WHEN query contains multiple keywords THEN the system SHALL prioritize products matching all keywords
3. WHEN using Turkish language variations THEN the system SHALL normalize text and handle grammatical cases
4. WHEN product categories match query intent THEN the system SHALL boost relevant category results
5. WHEN exact matches exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize them over partial matches

### Requirement 8: API Documentation and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want comprehensive API documentation and request validation, so that I can use the API correctly and get helpful error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN sending invalid requests THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with validation details
3. WHEN using API endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate request schemas and parameters
4. WHEN API changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide migration guides
5. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide interactive documentation interface

### Requirement 9: Rate Limiting and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want rate limiting and basic security measures, so that the system is protected from abuse and excessive usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users make requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per IP address
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 429 responses
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
5. WHEN serving API responses THEN the system SHALL include appropriate security headers

### Requirement 10: Health Check Endpoints

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want health check endpoints for monitoring and load balancing, so that I can ensure system availability and automate deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking system health THEN the system SHALL provide /health endpoint with status information
2. WHEN dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL report degraded health status
3. WHEN system is overloaded THEN the system SHALL provide detailed health metrics
4. WHEN monitoring tools query health THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
5. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable diagnostic information
