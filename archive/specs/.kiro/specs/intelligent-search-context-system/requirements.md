# Intelligent Search & Context System Requirements

## Introduction

The current chatbot system has three critical systematic issues that affect user experience across all product queries and conversations. These issues require comprehensive solutions rather than case-by-case fixes to ensure reliable and intelligent responses for any product catalog and conversation flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Semantic Search Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search system to find the exact product I'm looking for based on descriptive terms, so that I get relevant results instead of incorrect matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user searches with descriptive terms like "göğüs ve sırt dekolteli takım" THEN the system SHALL find products with matching descriptive features
2. WHEN multiple products have similar keywords THEN the system SHALL prioritize products with the highest semantic relevance
3. WHEN product descriptions contain specific features THEN the system SHALL weight those features heavily in search scoring
4. WHEN user uses synonyms or alternative descriptions THEN the system SHALL understand and match equivalent terms
5. WHEN search confidence is below threshold THEN the system SHALL present multiple options instead of guessing

### Requirement 2: Conversational Context Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to remember what we were discussing in recent messages, so that I can ask follow-up questions without repeating context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user asks about a product THEN the system SHALL store that product in conversation context
2. WHEN user asks a follow-up question like "fiyatı nedir" THEN the system SHALL apply the question to the previously discussed product
3. WHEN conversation context becomes ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification
4. WHEN user starts a new topic THEN the system SHALL appropriately transition context
5. WHEN context expires after inactivity THEN the system SHALL clear old context gracefully

### Requirement 3: Multi-Modal Search Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the search system to use multiple search strategies simultaneously, so that we get the best possible results regardless of query type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a search query THEN the system SHALL use semantic search, fuzzy matching, and keyword matching in parallel
2. WHEN different search methods return different results THEN the system SHALL intelligently combine and rank results
3. WHEN semantic search fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to other methods
4. WHEN search results have low confidence THEN the system SHALL present multiple options with explanations
5. WHEN no good matches are found THEN the system SHALL suggest similar or related products

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Product Feature Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically understand product features from names and descriptions, so that search accuracy improves without manual keyword mapping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing product data THEN the system SHALL extract key features from product names automatically
2. WHEN creating embeddings THEN the system SHALL include extracted features in the semantic representation
3. WHEN user searches with feature terms THEN the system SHALL match against extracted features
4. WHEN products have similar names THEN the system SHALL differentiate based on unique features
5. WHEN new products are added THEN the system SHALL automatically extract their features without manual configuration

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Cache with Context Awareness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our conversation flow intelligently, so that related questions are answered efficiently while maintaining context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL include conversation context in cache keys
2. WHEN user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL use context-aware cache lookup
3. WHEN cache entries become stale THEN the system SHALL invalidate them appropriately
4. WHEN context changes THEN the system SHALL not serve inappropriate cached responses
5. WHEN conversation flows naturally THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through intelligent caching

### Requirement 6: Advanced Intent Detection with Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand my questions in the context of our conversation, so that I don't need to repeat information or be overly specific.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user asks contextual questions THEN the system SHALL understand the implicit subject
2. WHEN intent is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use conversation history to disambiguate
3. WHEN user switches topics THEN the system SHALL detect the topic change appropriately
4. WHEN follow-up questions are asked THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation thread
5. WHEN context is insufficient THEN the system SHALL ask targeted clarifying questions

### Requirement 7: Search Result Confidence and Explanation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand why the system chose a particular product, so that I can trust the results and provide feedback if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning search results THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores
2. WHEN confidence is low THEN the system SHALL explain why and offer alternatives
3. WHEN multiple good matches exist THEN the system SHALL present options with distinguishing features
4. WHEN no exact match is found THEN the system SHALL explain what was searched for and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN user seems unsatisfied with results THEN the system SHALL offer to refine the search

### Requirement 8: Adaptive Learning from User Interactions

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to learn from user interactions and improve over time, so that search accuracy and user satisfaction increase continuously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with search results THEN the system SHALL track which results were helpful
2. WHEN users correct or clarify searches THEN the system SHALL learn from these corrections
3. WHEN certain queries consistently fail THEN the system SHALL identify patterns and suggest improvements
4. WHEN new search patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL adapt its algorithms accordingly
5. WHEN user feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL incorporate it into future search improvements

### Requirement 9: Robust Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful guidance, so that I can still accomplish my goals even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search systems fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative methods seamlessly
2. WHEN context is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover or ask for clarification
3. WHEN embeddings are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use traditional search methods
4. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests or use cached results
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization with Intelligence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be both intelligent and fast, so that users get accurate results quickly without sacrificing quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL optimize for both speed and accuracy
2. WHEN using multiple search methods THEN the system SHALL execute them efficiently in parallel
3. WHEN caching results THEN the system SHALL balance cache size with hit rates
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical operations
5. WHEN response times exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize or fallback to faster methods
