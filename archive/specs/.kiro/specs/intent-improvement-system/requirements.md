# Intent Improvement System - Requirements

## Introduction

Bu spec, mevcut Gemini Function Calling sisteminin intent detection ve response quality'sini sürekli geliştirmek için bir sistem tasarlar. Sistem, gerçek kullanıcı etkileşimlerinden öğrenerek kendini optimize edecek.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Intent Analysis

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor intent detection accuracy in real-time, so that I can identify and fix problematic queries immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user query is processed THEN the system SHALL log the query, detected intent, confidence score, and response quality
2. WHEN intent confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL flag the query for manual review
3. WHEN a query fails to match any intent THEN the system SHALL categorize it as "unknown" and suggest similar successful queries
4. WHEN the system processes 100 queries THEN it SHALL generate an intent accuracy report

### Requirement 2: Automatic Intent Learning

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to automatically learn from successful interactions, so that similar queries get better responses over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query receives positive user feedback THEN the system SHALL strengthen the intent pattern
2. WHEN similar queries consistently succeed THEN the system SHALL create new intent variations
3. WHEN a product name appears frequently in queries THEN the system SHALL add it to the product recognition dictionary
4. WHEN seasonal patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL adjust intent priorities accordingly

### Requirement 3: Failed Query Recovery

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the system to provide helpful suggestions when it doesn't understand my query, so that I can get the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN intent detection fails THEN the system SHALL suggest 3 similar successful queries
2. WHEN a product is not found THEN the system SHALL suggest similar available products
3. WHEN query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions
4. WHEN user rephrases a failed query THEN the system SHALL learn the new pattern

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically optimize response times, so that users get faster service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN response time exceeds 500ms THEN the system SHALL analyze bottlenecks
2. WHEN cache hit rate drops below 60% THEN the system SHALL optimize caching strategy
3. WHEN concurrent requests exceed 100 THEN the system SHALL implement load balancing
4. WHEN database queries are slow THEN the system SHALL suggest index optimizations

### Requirement 5: Multi-language Support

**User Story:** As a business expanding internationally, I want the system to support multiple languages, so that I can serve customers in their preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is in English THEN the system SHALL process it with English intent patterns

2. WHEN customers ask about missing features THEN the system SHALL flag improvement opportunities
3. WHEN query volume spikes THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
4. WHEN customer satisfaction drops THEN the system SHALL identify root causes

### Requirement 7: A/B Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to test different response strategies, so that I can optimize customer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running A/B tests THEN the system SHALL randomly assign users to test groups
2. WHEN comparing response strategies THEN the system SHALL measure success metrics
3. WHEN a test shows significant improvement THEN the system SHALL recommend deployment

3. WHEN new products are added THEN the system SHALL automatically learn their attributes
4. WHEN prices change THEN the system SHALL reflect updates in real-time

### Requirement 9: Security and Privacy

2. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
3. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL comply within 24 hours
4. WHEN detecting malicious queries THEN the system SHALL block and log the attempt

### Requirement 10: Scalability and Reliability
