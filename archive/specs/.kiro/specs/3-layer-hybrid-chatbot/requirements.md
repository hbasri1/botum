# 3 Katmanlı Hibrit Chatbot Sistemi - Requirements

## Introduction

Bu spec, maliyet-etkin, ölçeklenebilir ve kendi kendine öğrenen 3 katmanlı hibrit chatbot sistemini tanımlar. Sistem, her sorguyu pahalı AI'ya göndermek yerine akıllı filtreleme ile maliyeti optimize eder ve semantik arama ile yüksek doğruluk sağlar.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: 3 Katmanlı Filtreleme Sistemi

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want queries to be processed through cost-optimized layers, so that I minimize API costs while maintaining response quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user query arrives THEN the system SHALL process it through Layer 1 (Cache) first
2. WHEN Layer 1 has no match THEN the system SHALL try Layer 2 (Router)
3. WHEN Layer 2 has no match THEN the system SHALL use Layer 3 (Gemini AI)
4. WHEN a query is resolved in Layer 1 or 2 THEN no API cost SHALL be incurred

### Requirement 2: Layer 1 - Cache System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want frequently asked identical questions to be answered instantly from cache, so that response time is minimized and API costs are zero.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exact query match exists in cache THEN the system SHALL return the cached response immediately
2. WHEN cache hit occurs THEN response time SHALL be under 5ms
3. WHEN cache is updated THEN new entries SHALL be immediately available
4. WHEN cache reaches capacity THEN LRU eviction SHALL be applied

### Requirement 3: Layer 2 - Router System

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious business owner, I want simple keyword-based queries to be handled without AI API calls, so that operational costs remain low.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query contains predefined keywords THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate handler
2. WHEN routing succeeds THEN no external API call SHALL be made
3. WHEN new keywords are identified THEN they SHALL be added to routing rules
4. WHEN routing fails THEN query SHALL proceed to Layer 3

### Requirement 4: Layer 3 - Gemini AI Integration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want complex queries to be understood semantically, so that I get accurate responses even with unclear wording.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query reaches Layer 3 THEN Gemini API SHALL be called for intent detection
2. WHEN Gemini detects product query THEN semantic search SHALL be triggered
3. WHEN Gemini response is received THEN it SHALL be cached for future use
4. WHEN API call fails THEN fallback response SHALL be provided

### Requirement 5: Semantic Product Search (RAG)

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to find products even when I misspell names or use different terms, so that I can discover relevant items easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product embeddings are created THEN they SHALL include name, color, category, and description
2. WHEN user searches for products THEN semantic similarity SHALL be calculated
3. WHEN similar products are found THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance
4. WHEN no exact match exists THEN semantically similar products SHALL be suggested

### Requirement 6: PostgreSQL + pgvector Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use existing database infrastructure with vector capabilities, so that setup costs and complexity are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pgvector extension is installed THEN vector operations SHALL be available
2. WHEN product embeddings are stored THEN they SHALL use pgvector data types
3. WHEN similarity search is performed THEN pgvector functions SHALL be used
4. WHEN database queries are made THEN performance SHALL be optimized with proper indexing

### Requirement 7: Offline Learning System

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to automatically improve based on real usage patterns, so that accuracy increases over time without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Layer 3 queries are processed THEN they SHALL be logged with success/failure status
2. WHEN weekly analysis runs THEN Gemini 1.5 Pro SHALL analyze logged interactions
3. WHEN new patterns are identified THEN cache and router rules SHALL be suggested
4. WHEN suggestions are approved THEN they SHALL be automatically integrated

### Requirement 8: Cost Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to operate under $15/month even with high traffic, so that it remains economically viable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache hit rate exceeds 40% THEN Layer 3 API calls SHALL be reduced accordingly
2. WHEN router handles 30% of queries THEN no API costs SHALL be incurred for those
3. WHEN embedding API is used THEN Google's cost-effective models SHALL be preferred
4. WHEN monthly costs are calculated THEN they SHALL not exceed $15 for 100K queries

### Requirement 9: Performance Requirements

**User Story:** As a customer, I want fast responses regardless of which layer processes my query, so that my experience is smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Layer 1 processes query THEN response time SHALL be under 5ms
2. WHEN Layer 2 processes query THEN response time SHALL be under 20ms
3. WHEN Layer 3 processes query THEN response time SHALL be under 500ms
4. WHEN system is under load THEN 95% of queries SHALL meet response time targets

### Requirement 10: Scalability and Reliability

**User Story:** As a growing business, I want the system to handle increasing traffic without degrading performance or increasing costs proportionally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic increases by 10x THEN cache layer SHALL absorb most additional load
2. WHEN database queries increase THEN pgvector indexing SHALL maintain performance
3. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN request queuing SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN system components fail THEN graceful degradation SHALL occur
